# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I haven't had much to struggle with in this section. What I *did* struggle with was methods that I was trying to include variables in. There are additional steps that I was not aware of to make them work and it caused me to waste a lot of time.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I am finding my note taking very helpful. I have a nice little cheat sheet that I keep adding to as I encounter new terms.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I tend to try to write it based off my own ideas. I'll google my specific thoughts before I just google for a solution if that makes any sense? I'll google if there already exists a method that suits my train of though before I google "I need x to do y".
